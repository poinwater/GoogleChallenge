# Google Challeng - 2021

## Project Description
The project is a solution for [Google Solution Challenge 2021](https://developers.google.com/community/dsc-solution-challenge).
In this challenge, participants are asked to solve one or more of [the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development](https://developers.google.com/community/dsc-solution-challenge/UN-goals) Goals using Google technology.
Our team chose [Goal 3 Good Health & Wellbeing](https://developers.google.com/community/dsc-solution-challenge/UN-goals#goal-3br-good-health-wellbeing).
We develop an application called sleep.play to help people to build healthy habits by playing a game. The application can softly lock the user's screen. If the user sleeps and wakes up on time, the user will obtain bonus including virtual coins and random items. Users can use the bonus to make a custom for their original characters and share their characters with other users in the community.

## Future Work
Due to the time, we only could finish the main functions including the timing feature, bonus system, data analysis chart, and the database. In the future, we will:
1. Allowing users to make custome using items and blueprint
2. Adding four dreamlands providing different items for making custome
3. Allowing users to define their characters.
